# Tag By Group

This plugin allows topics to be automatically tagged based on the topic author's group memberships. Group-name, tag-name
relations are set by adding comma separated pairs of group-names/tag-names to the plugin's `tag by group tags for groups` setting.

To configure the tags so that they can only be seen by staff members, add the tag names to a Tag Group that is set to be only visible to staff.
